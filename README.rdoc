== README

This is a basic app for creating How-To lists. 

Runs in Ruby 2.1 with Rails 4.0. Database is SQLite3. Tests can be run with <tt>rake test</tt>

Steps belong to guides, guides have many steps. When entering new guides and steps, make sure to check that you have the step number correct. It can be changed later, though.
